# ColReorderResize

ColReorderResize adds the ability for the end user to click and drag column headers to reorder and resize a table as they see fit, to DataTables. See the [documentation](http://legacy.datatables.net/extras/thirdparty/ColReorderWithResize/) for full details.

This repository is based on a no longer supported version of the ColReorderWithResize plugin. I basically updated it to work with the latest version of DataTables and fixed some long-standing issues with the plugin.
